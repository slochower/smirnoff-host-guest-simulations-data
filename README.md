# Background
After dealing with a giant `.git` folder that really gunked up the works, I decided to split the simulation data and analysis. This is always a good idea, but in this case, since the setup also required writing a bunch of scripts and testing things out in notebooks, I accumulated cruft in multiple directories. 

# To do
- Add a manifest
- Make sure notebooks and scripts are now self-consistent
